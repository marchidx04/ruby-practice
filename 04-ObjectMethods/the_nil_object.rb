# nil is an object that represents emptiness, blankness
puts nil
p nil

# this is still valid syntax and Ruby is still going to output hello to the console
# when the programs runs and this is on the righ hand side of our equal sign.
# So this is going to evaluate first and print
what_is_the_value_here = puts "Hello"
# Here's an object called nil that basically means storing nothing, holding nothing.
p what_is_the_value_here # nil
